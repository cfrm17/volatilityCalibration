# volatilityCalibration
The robust estimate of volatility methodology is described.  The distribution is estimated as a t-distribution with degrees of freedom parameter ν= 4.5.  The value of ν was selected by calculating the estimation error in recovering a known volatility from simulated data from a t-distribution.
